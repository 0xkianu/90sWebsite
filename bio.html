        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <p>
            Gaia is a loving but shy dog.  She is usually fearful of strangers but once she warms to a person, is very friendly.  Gaia is always anxious to play with other dogs as she is the only pet in her household and longs for a companion.
            Gaia has low agression and always displays submissive behavior around new animals.  At home, Gaia is very affectionate with her family, looking for physical contact.  Gaia loves to nap and she spends
            most of her days sleeping.  When she is not sleeping, Gaia loves to take walks and socialize with other dogs at the dog park.
